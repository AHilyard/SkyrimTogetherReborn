skyrim together problems:

naked npcs
animations often not synced
random items/npcs/mobs not synced
can't find other party members easily
can't pass time easily
multiple potions consumed at once
side quests and first step of story quests not synced
home storage not synced (it gets wiped randomly)
dropped items not synced
You can still hit other players (and gain skill) when pvp is disabled even though no damage is dealt
